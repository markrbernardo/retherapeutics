                        <p>On the day of your appointment, you will have the opportunity to talk with your therapist and decide on how you want to approach your massage session. You may either choose a full-body massage (for general relaxation) or a customized session (for specific parts of your body). Your therapist will discuss what kind of modalities they recommend to best suit your massage goals. </p>

                        <p>It is important to ease your muscles and your mind. Make sure to maintain an even breath and try not to tense your muscles. Keep an open communication with your therapist for feedback on pressure and techniques. If you are uncomfortable, make sure your therapist knows.</p>

                        <p>After your session, your therapist will step aside to give you time to get re-acquainted with your body. They will also ask a couple questions for a re-assessment to record what their treatment was successful at and where more work is needed. This information helps us keep track of your overall progress and fine-tune your future massage sessions to achieve the goals you have set for your own body.</p>
